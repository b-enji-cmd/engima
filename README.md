# Enigma

Project Guidelines here https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/enigma/index





<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repository was a solo project for the Turing School of Software and Design. A program that is built to encrypt and decrpyt messages using the day or a provided code stub


### Built With

* [Ruby](https://ruby-doc.org)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Create `message.txt` in root directory of project
3. Write your plaintext message in `message.txt` 
4. Run the script
```
$ruby encrypt.rb message.txt encoded.txt
```
5. Open `encoded.txt` to see your message 
### Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.5.3

### Reflection

This being my final project for the first 6 weeks during my attendance at Turing, I took a lot of pride in having a slim and clean cut structure using concepts and topics that 
had not been introduced to us. As well as more advanced ruby mechanics such as the `reduce` enumerable with the injection of modules. There were additional extensions which I could not manage to complete. One of those features was the ability to crack the internal calculation and mathematical process of how the messages are encoded. Overall I really enjoyed this project as it was related to cryptography and encryption, two fascinating concepts!
